Frankly, I never write reviews in zomato but their service has forced me to write one now. I have ordered countless times from this outlet and it has never disappointed me as a customer. I have tried their Burgers, parathas, nuggets, lasange, momos and many other items and taste was never unsound. yes I agree that the items are a little overpriced but hey, we shouldn't forget the kind of service they are providing. Few days back, I ordered my fav chicken burgers along with some snacks at 2:30 AM. Delivery guy took around 1 hour to reach my at my door where it usually takes them 30 mins max to deliver at my address. He told me that the tire of bike got punctured so he left his bike near some petrol bunk and walked the way up to my flat. Really commendable!
